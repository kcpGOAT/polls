This project does some graphical work regarding polls from FiveThirtyEight. For example, there is a poll regarding people's views on coronavirus, and there is a poll that measures people's approval of President Joe Biden. Using these polls, the project produces some various data visualizations that help the reader obtain a better comprehension of the data.
